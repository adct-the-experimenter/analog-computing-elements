# Analog Computing Elements

This is a collection of circuits and spice models that make up
individual computing elements of an analog computer.

Circuits taken from examples in the book "Analog and Hybrid Computer Programmer" by Bernd Ulmann.

The circuits are intended to be for use as a later stage revision of a prototype 
of custom analog computing elements that take into account op-amp selection, frequency response, stability,
noise rejection, and power supply rejection. 

### Circuits are not ready for production.
